Pegasus-Xploit is simply a shell script that helps you to generate metasploit payloads and starts the meterpreter handler quickly. At times, security researchers have to generate payloads and listen to the connection through handler constantly, Pegasus-Xploit not only allows you to quickly generate payloads but it also has an option to start the handler automatically.
